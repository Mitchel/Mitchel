## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! Iâ€™m Mitchel, 27 years young and living in the beautiful town of Maarssen, Netherlands. My passion for technology has taken me on an exciting journey into the world of full-stack development. As a Lead Engineer and Manager Support at a custom software company, I have the privilege of putting my love for technology and innovation into practice every day. In my free time, youâ€™ll often find me enthusiastically working behind my screen, diving into the world of building complete applications. I thoroughly enjoy exploring and integrating new, innovative features, always looking for ways to elevate my projects to the next level.

But thereâ€™s more! Beyond my work as a developer, Iâ€™m also a creative soul. I love spending time in Photoshop and Illustrator, where I can let my design skills run wild to create visual masterpieces. The combination of technology and creativity is where I truly shine. In short, Iâ€™m someone who thrives on the perfect balance between technology and creativity, and Iâ€™m always excited to tackle my next project!

If youâ€™re interested in collaborating on a project, want to learn more about me, or just feel like chatting, feel free to drop me a message! Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
